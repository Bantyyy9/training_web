      I love whining people and bullying, Bukunmi said i don get shoulderpad for
      body which i feel he is wrong cos he knows i don't. I don't like pets i
      guess but i'm a lil bit of an annoying person. I can whine you to stuppor.
      I Love snacks too, anytime i'm in my mom's shop i go snacks hunting which
      i like. <br />
